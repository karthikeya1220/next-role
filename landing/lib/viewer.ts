 * Who is looking at the page, in the two parts the site actually cares about.
 *
 * They are genuinely separate states and the UI has to tell them apart:
 *
 * * signed out - nothing but a "continue with Google" button;
 * * signed in, no profile - Google knows them, the wall does not, so they get
 *   the onboarding form rather than a post button;
 * * signed in with a profile - on the wall, and allowed to post.
 *
 * Returning an unreachable database as "no profile" rather than throwing keeps
 * the pages readable when Neon is cold or down, the same way the wall itself
 * degrades to an empty list.
