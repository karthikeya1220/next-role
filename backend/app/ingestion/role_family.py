"""Which job family does this title belong to?

The key insight from real data: **"Engineer" alone means nothing.** These all
contain it and none are software roles:

    GTM Engineer · Customer Success Engineer · Product Solution Engineer
    Service Delivery Engineer · Network Delivery Engineer

So classification runs in three stages:

1. **Strong signals** — unambiguous role names ("Software Engineer", "SRE",
   "Data Engineer") win immediately, so "Service Delivery Engineer, SRE" is
   correctly kept as devops.
2. **Routing** — business, sales, creative, finance and HR keywords send a title
   to the family it really belongs to. These used to be a reject list; they are
   a destination list now, so a design or product student sees their roles too.
   Whether a family is *wanted* is the user's choice (`preferences.role_families`),
   not this module's.
3. **Family keywords** — whatever is left is matched per technical family, most
   specific first (ai_ml → data → devops → software), so "ML Platform Engineer"
   lands in ai_ml rather than software.

Deterministic on purpose: ~0ms versus ~25s for an LLM call, free, explainable and
unit-testable. Same reasoning as the seniority pre-filter.
