"""Enrichment: extract requirements, embed each job, score it against the KB.

    python -m app.ingestion.enrich [--limit N]

Split from `run` (ingestion) because the two have completely different costs.
Ingestion is a few seconds of HTTP. Extraction is ~25s of local LLM per job, so
this stage is built to be **resumable**: work is cached by the job's
`content_hash` and re-running only processes what is genuinely new or changed.

Matching itself is cheap and deterministic, so it is always recomputed — your
scores stay correct after you edit your knowledge base.
