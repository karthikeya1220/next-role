"""Is this title plausibly open to a fresher / new grad?

This runs *before* the LLM on purpose. Deciding "Senior Staff Engineer" is not a
fresher role takes a regex and 0ms; asking a local model costs ~25s. Skipping
clearly-senior postings up front removes hours from every enrichment run.

Deliberately conservative: it only rejects titles that are unambiguously senior,
because a wrongly-dropped job is invisible, while a wrongly-kept one just ranks low.
