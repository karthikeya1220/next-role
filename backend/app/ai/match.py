"""Explainable matching: how well does the candidate's KB fit one job?

Deliberately NOT "ask the LLM if this is a good match". A single opaque number
cannot answer "why 62%?", cannot be tuned, and changes its mind between runs.
Instead we compute four independent, inspectable features and combine them with
a transparent weighted sum.

    score = 0.35*required_coverage
          + 0.30*semantic_similarity
          + 0.20*preferred_coverage
          + 0.15*keyword_overlap

Why these weights: for a fresher, whether you actually have the *required*
skills dominates. Semantic similarity is next — it catches relevance that exact
strings miss ("built REST APIs" vs "backend services"). Preferred skills and raw
keyword overlap are useful tie-breakers, not decisions.

`preference_fit` (what the user *wants*) is intentionally absent: the preferences
table does not exist yet. Adding a fifth feature that silently reads nothing
would be worse than four honest ones.
