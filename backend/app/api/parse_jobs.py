"""In-memory registry of running document-parse jobs.

Deliberately not a table. A parse job exists only until the user reviews the
chunks it proposed — minutes, never across a restart — and its result is a
throwaway list the user is about to edit anyway. A migration for that would be
ceremony around nothing.

The trade is explicit: restart the backend mid-parse and the job is gone, and
the user uploads again.
