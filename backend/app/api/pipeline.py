"""Run the long pipeline steps from the browser.

Fetching jobs takes minutes and scoring takes tens of minutes, so neither can
happen inside an HTTP request. Each starts a background thread that owns its own
database session and writes progress to a `pipeline_runs` row; the browser polls
that row.

**Only one run at a time.** The `running` row is the lock — without it a second
click would start a second forty-minute job against the same tables. The check
and the insert happen in one transaction so two near-simultaneous clicks cannot
both win.
