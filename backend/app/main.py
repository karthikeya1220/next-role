# same machine. Pinning an exact port was a trap: when :3000 is already taken
# Next silently starts on :3001, every preflight then fails CORS, and the
# CORSMiddleware answers 400 before the request reaches a route - so the app
# renders completely empty with a healthy backend and no error on the page.
# Any localhost port is allowed instead. This binds to 127.0.0.1 and holds
# nothing but your own data, so the origin check was never the security
# boundary - not being reachable off this machine is.
